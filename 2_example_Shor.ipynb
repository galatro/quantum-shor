    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Base Selection Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some base choices did not match the expected behavior of the algorithm, leading to inefficiencies or failures in factoring.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Steps for Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem:**\n",
    "   - The goal is to factor the number **15** using Shor's algorithm. The number 15 is a relatively small number, making it an ideal candidate for initial testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the Quantum Circuit:**\n",
    "   - Build the quantum circuit that implements Shor's algorithm. This includes setting up the necessary qubits and gates for performing **modular exponentiation** and the **QFT**.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Set Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Select the base `a` for the modular exponentiation step. For the number 15, common choices for `a` include values like 2 or 4, but we will experiment with different bases to observe how they affect the results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Run the Simulation:**\n",
    "   - Using **Qiskit**, we will simulate the Shor algorithm on a classical simulator. This allows us to test the algorithm without needing access to quantum hardware, providing a faster turnaround for debugging and fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analyze Results:**\n",
    "   - After running the simulation, we will analyze the output to determine if the algorithm successfully factors the number 15. If the result is correct, we will proceed to test larger numbers and move towards using actual quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Step?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating Shor's algorithm locally for factoring a small number like 15 will give us an initial understanding of how well the quantum circuit performs. It also allows us to identify any potential issues with the implementation before scaling to more complex numbers or running on actual quantum machines.\n"

    "The **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** is a key component of Shor's algorithm, used to extract periodicity from the quantum state. The inverse of QFT, often called **QFT Dagger** or `qft_dagger`, is used to reverse the effects of QFT. This inverse transform is essential when you need to process the quantum state after applying the Fourier transform and obtain the required results for classical post-processing.\n",

    "#### Function: `qft_dagger(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **QFT Dagger** performs the inverse operation of QFT. The purpose of this step is to reverse the quantum state transformation applied by QFT, allowing us to read out the information encoded in the quantum registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QFT Dagger is implemented using quantum gates that undo the operations of the QFT, and it can be understood as performing a reverse order of operations compared to the QFT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase Shift Gates (Inverse)**: These gates adjust the relative phases in the quantum state.\n",
    "- **Hadamard Gates**: Reversed in order, applied from the highest to the lowest qubit.\n",
    "- **Swap Gates**: The qubits are swapped in reverse order compared to the QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps for `qft_dagger(n)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Quantum State:**\n",
    "   - Before applying QFT Dagger, a quantum state has been transformed by QFT, and you need to reverse it to obtain meaningful results.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Inverse of Phase Shifts:**\n",
    "   - Apply the inverse of the phase shift gates used in QFT. The inverse of the controlled phase shift gate is applied to each qubit, starting from the highest qubit and working downwards.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Hadamard Gates (In Reverse):**\n",
    "   - Apply Hadamard gates in reverse order, starting from the highest qubit to the lowest. This is the reverse of the Hadamard gate application in the QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Swap the Qubits:**\n",
    "   - After applying the inverse phase shifts and Hadamard gates, swap the qubits in the reverse order to undo the transformations made during QFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Result:**\n",
    "   - Once the QFT Dagger is applied, the quantum state will be transformed in such a way that the periodicity information needed for further processing or measurement can be extracted.\n"
